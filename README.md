# Dejanovic Family Web Application React + Vite

## Overview

This project is a web application dedicated to the Dejanovic family, created with the intention of preserving and sharing family history. The idea for the project came after realizing that there is no information available online about my great-great-grandmother, Katica Dejanovic. 

The application provides an interactive and visually appealing experience, combining modern web design principles with user-friendly functionality. It showcases key features such as an image slider, light and dark mode toggle, dynamic tabs for navigation, and a registration form.

## Motivation

The Dejanovic family has a rich history, yet much of it remains undocumented online. This project is a personal endeavor to fill that gap and provide a platform where family members and others interested in our heritage can connect and learn more.
